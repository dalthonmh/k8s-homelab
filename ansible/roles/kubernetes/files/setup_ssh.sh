# Created: 2025-11-04, dalthonmh
# Description:
# This script sets up SSH key-based access from the master node to worker nodes
# in a Kubernetes cluster. It generates an SSH key (if missing), copies it to
# the worker nodes, and configures the SSH client for seamless access.

# Requirements:
# - Run this script as the "superadmin" user (do NOT use sudo).
# - Ensure the "hosts.ini" file is in the same directory as this script.

# Notes:
# - You will be prompted to confirm the SSH connection:
#   "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?": yes
# - Enter the "superadmin" password for each worker node when prompted.

# Usage:
#   ./setup_ssh.sh

# Variables
SSH_KEY_NAME="id_ansible_master_debian"
SSH_DIR="$HOME/.ssh"
INVENTORY_FILE="./hosts.ini"
USER="superadmin"

# Get worker node IPs from hosts.ini
